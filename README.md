# FANATSY PREMIER LEAGUE ANALYSIS

## FPL
Fantasy Premier League is a game that casts you in the role of a Fantasy manager. You are given the task to pick a squad of real-life players who score points for your team based on their performances in their own matches.

## ANALYSIS
The FPL is complicated and strategic game. You need to include players in your squad taht have a highest chance of producing points, but you are limited by player prices and positions. There are many factors to consider whrn transfering plyer in or out player and team form, fixtures, price rises and falls and much more. So to make this a bit easier I am trying to make some tools to collect team data write it in easy to work with csv files and then analyse that with python. FPL is played through entirety of premier league season. And i am trying to make these tools be useful for every gameweek.

### TOP MANAGERS
My first analysis will be about some top managers from previus years. I hope I can find some common factors between them that I can then apply to my managerial skills.

### MINI LEAGUE
The second task is about tools that will enable analysing mini lagues. These are smaller leagues in which you are compiting with your friends. Also here would I analyse teams participating and try to find some inforamtion on how to win.
